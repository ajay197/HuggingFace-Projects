# Image Semantics (Captioning) - README

## Overview

**Image Semantics (Captioning)** is a project that uses deep learning models to generate textual descriptions (captions) for uploaded images. The project leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically the BLIP image-captioning model by Salesforce, to analyze and describe image content. The user interface is built using Gradio for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

The project is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces and can be accessed at:

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in various formats.
- **Caption Generation**: Automatically generates a textual description for the uploaded image using the BLIP model.
- **Clear Functionality**: Users can clear uploaded images and generated captions with a single click.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with Gradio's simple and interactive layout.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `huggingface_hub`
- `gradio`
- `Pillow`
- `torch`

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate huggingface_hub gradio
```

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image through the Gradio interface.
2. **Caption Generation**: The uploaded image is passed to the BLIP image-captioning model, which generates a descriptive caption.
3. **Display Results**: The generated caption is displayed in the output text box.
4. **Clear Fields**: A "Clear" button allows users to reset the input image and caption output.

## Code Explanation

### Key Components

1. **Image-to-Text Pipeline**:  
   The `transformers.pipeline` function initializes the BLIP model for image captioning.

   ```python
   pipe = pipeline("image-to-text", model="Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large")
   ```

2. **Caption Generation Function**:  
   The `generate_semantics` function uses the model to generate captions for uploaded images.

   ```python
   def generate_semantics(image):
       caption = pipe(image)[0]['generated_text']
       return caption
   ```

3. **Clear Function**:  
   A simple utility to reset the image and caption fields.

   ```python
   def clear_fields_caption():
       return None, ""
   ```

4. **Gradio Interface**:  
   The interface uses Gradio's `Blocks` and `Tabs` for organizing the layout. Buttons and interactions are defined to handle user inputs and outputs.

   ```python
   with gr.Blocks(css="...") as iface:
       ...
       generate_button.click(
           fn=generate_semantics,
           inputs=uploaded_image,
           outputs=generated_caption
       )

       clear_button.click(
           fn=clear_fields_caption,
           inputs=None,
           outputs=[uploaded_image, generated_caption]
       )
   ```

---

## Running the Application

1. Save the code in a `.py` file or use a notebook.
2. Run the script. The Gradio app will start and provide a URL for accessing the interface.
3. Upload an image and click the **Generate Semantics** button to view the generated caption.
4. Use the **Clear** button to reset fields for a new input.
