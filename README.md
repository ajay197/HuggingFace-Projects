## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
All projects are designed to run on Hugging Face Spaces, so no installation is required. If you want to run the code locally, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `transformers`, `accelerate`, `huggingface_hub`, `gradio`, `diffusers`, `torch`, and other relevant dependencies.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate huggingface_hub gradio diffusers torch numpy
```

### Running Locally
Clone the project repository and run the scripts directly on your local machine. Detailed instructions are included in each project's code file.
